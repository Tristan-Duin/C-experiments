# C Programming Concepts & Experiments

Welcome to my personal C programming repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey learning the C language through a variety of concepts, mini projects, and small scale experiments. It's a mix of fundamentals and practical applications written in C.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Solidify my understanding of C programming.
- Practice writing clean, modular, and efficient C code.
- Explore core concepts through hands-on experimentation.
- Showcase my learning and growth in the language.
